# Respiratory
This repository is for lung adventitious sound detection. (The codes will be publicly accessible upon acceptance/publication of our paper under consideration)
# Dataset
The repository uses the ICBHI 2017 respiratory sound dataset, accessible at https://bhichallenge.med.auth.gr/ICBHI_2017_Challenge. The dataset is employed for classifying lung adventitious sounds into four distinct groups: Normal, WHEEZE, Cackle, and Wheeze+Crackle.
# Details on running the code
To execute the code successfully, download all files and place them in the same directory. Initiate by running Feature_vector.py, followed by classifier.py. For visualizing results, use the plot.py file. Ensure the presence of the module.py file in the same location as these files to import necessary packages and functions.
